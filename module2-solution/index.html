                    called chutney. Onion bhajji features thinly sliced onions that have been added to the chickpea

                <p>Another popular Indian street food is the samosa. Samosas contain a small amount of spicy potato or

                    pav is essentially a spicier vegetarian version of sliders where the dumpling or patty is sandwiched
                    between two halves of a dinner roll.</p>
